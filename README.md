# 1.Semantics-Accessibility
First week challenge--Refactor code to optimize accessibility for visually impaired users

What did I do:

    - Added a title for browser tab and google search accessibility.
    - Changed <div> elements to <nav> and <section> semantic elements, respectively.
    - Added "alt=speech to text" to images and double checked with a speech-to-text extension to make sure it worked.
        (note: speech-to-text extension keeps saying "section" at the end of every paragraph, not sure why?)
    - Adjusted CSS to match tags / classes in HTML
